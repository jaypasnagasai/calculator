# Calculator

This is a Python program that implements an advanced calculator capable of performing various mathematical operations. The calculator provides a user-friendly interface to perform calculations and interact with the memory feature for storing values.

## Features

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, modulo operations
- Square root, sine, cosine, tangent calculations
- Memory operations: Memory addition, memory subtraction, memory recall, memory clear
- User-friendly interface for input and interaction
- Graceful handling of division by zero and negative square roots

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the `calculator.py` file.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the `calculator.py` file.
4. Run the following command to start the calculator:
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform calculations and interact with the calculator.

## Usage Instructions

1. Enter the first number.
2. Enter the operation:
- `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**` for basic arithmetic operations.
- `sqrt` for calculating the square root of a number.
- `sin`, `cos`, `tan` for trigonometric calculations.
- `M+` to add the current number to memory.
- `M-` to subtract the current number from memory.
- `MR` to recall the value stored in memory.
- `MC` to clear the memory.
- `q` to quit the calculator.
3. Depending on the operation, you might be prompted to enter a second number.
4. The result of the operation will be displayed, rounded to 2 decimal places.
5. Optionally, you can choose to perform another calculation or quit the calculator.

## Notes

- Division by zero is not allowed, and the calculator will display an error message.
- Calculating the square root of a negative number will result in an error.
- Invalid operations will be rejected with an error message.
